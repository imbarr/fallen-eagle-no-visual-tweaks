 TFE_descendants_of_li_ling_desc:0 "This nomad clan is not like other nomad clans. They are unique in claiming descent from the Han general Li Ling, himself a descendant of the fearsome "Flying General" Li Guang. Li Ling was forced to serve the Xiongnu after losing to them in battle and never returned to his homeland, and has become a legendary if controversial, tragic hero of both the steppe tribes and in China. It is said that he carried a deep sorrow in his heart, one still carried by his descendants."
