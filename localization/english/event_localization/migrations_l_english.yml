Most importantly, the situation on the mainland has forced the Roman government in Mediolanum to focus on the defense of the Rhine and the Danube, leaving Britannia largely vulnerable and undefended. As Roman dominion over Britannia shrivels into ash by the day, what is a better time for us to carve out a new homeland along the white cliffs, within the dense forests, and among the temples and palaces of Camulodunum and Londinium?"
