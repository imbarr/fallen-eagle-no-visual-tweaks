 tfe_culture.0002.desc:0 "The [aestian.GetName] tribes have lived in the cold, misty forests of the Baltic Sea for centuries. In the course of centuries, they have slowly but gradually begun to diverge in their way of life, their way of thinking, and their way of being. Obviously, they still share many cultural elements, but one cannot speak of a culturally homogenous, undivided [aestian.GetName] people anymore. Will these differences result in greater conflicts in the future, or will these Baltic tribes still embrace their shared ancestry?"

 tfe_culture.0012.desc:0 "The [antean.GetName] tribes are Slavs who have made their home around the Dnieper and Don rivers for many, many generations. Times are changing, however, as minor variations in habits and ideas become major differences in customs and worldview. The [antean.GetName] peoples can no longer be considered a singular group; they have, in truth, become several different, distinct Slavic tribes.\n\nThe lands around the Dnieper and Don are vast and rugged, so this was inevitable. Perhaps one day a powerful leader will reunite them into a mighty state; perhaps not. Only time will tell."

 tfe_culture.0022.desc:0 "The far reaches of the cold north are considered dangerous and uninhabitable to many, but not for the [fenni.GetName] people. They have lived here for as long as anyone can remember, and people from elsewhere often see them as a mysterious group, forever trapped in an unchanging, remote, wintry land of ice and snow.\n\nHowever, anyone who lives in these lands long enough knows that winter does not last forever. Eventually, spring comes, and snows melt.\n\nA new spring has, indeed, arrived for the [fenni.GetName] tribes. Various political, social, and economic trends have led them to split into many different groups, even if they retain some shared customs and beliefs. Perhaps even greater changes and greater opportunities await these tribes in the long run, even if outsiders might not be fully aware of their implications."

 tfe_culture.0032.desc:0 "Many years ago, the [venedian.GetName] Slavs spread deep into Central Europe, settling in the forested lands around the Vistula river. Generations have passed since then, however, and the [venedian.GetName] tribes have begun to grow distant from one another, as they each begin to develop their own distinct customs, norms, and way of seeing things. In other words, these westernmost of Slavs can no longer be considered one singular group."

It has been generations since they migrated far from their homeland, however, and it has begun to affect their way of life as they begin to split into different groups and absorb ideas from their neighbors.\n\nThe [sclavenian.GetName] Slavs have, ultimately, split into two distinct branches. It remains yet to be seen what the leaders of either group have planned for their people."

Disparate steppe tribes often unite for mutual aid and protection, even if at first they might not share a speech, a culture, a faith, or even physical appearance.\n\nLong ago, the [tiele.GetName] were once many tribes who came together as one. Even if they weren't politically united, they still shared a dream as a culture. But they were not the first to do so on the steppes. Now, just like the others before them, their dream is gone. Similarities are differences again, unity has become division, shared ideals have become conflicts of interest.\n\nAll down the ages the notes of change ring, for fate so rules it; none escapes its sway. Tiele unity has vanished as a dream."
