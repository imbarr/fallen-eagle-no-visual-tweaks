According to legend, Guayota kidnapped the sun Magec and trapped it in the volcano Teide, plunging the world into darkness. Humans prayed to Achamán who saved Magec, and instead locked the evil Guayota up in the Teide, where Guayota will reside forever. Guayota continues to torment humans via his offspring, the Tibicenas, demons with the bodies of great wild dogs with red eyes and covered by long black fur. Tibicenas live in deep caves and like their father Guayota, inside mountains; they are also known come out at night to attack humans or livestock."
