 bm_395_empire:0 "A Divided Empire"
 bm_395_empire_desc:1 "Emperor Theodosius has died, and as he slumbers beneath the earth, the Roman world above him burns under chaos, corruption, and self-destruction. Upon his death, the Roman Empire was divided, with his two sons inheriting the two halves of the empire, Honorius in the West, and Arcadius in the East. Both are unable to stop the Germanic and Hunnic invaders, and the Western Empire seems on the verge of total collapse. \n\n#bold Can the brothers prevent the downfall of their empires, or will they let Roman civilization be snuffed out?#!"

His advisor and general, Flavius Stilicho oversees the empire's administration, but his leniency towards the Visigoths under Alaric has created him many enemies in the government. Can Honorius seize absolute power and drive back the barbarian hordes over the Rhine and Danube, or will he let the Western Roman Empire crumble to dust?#!"

 #Emperor Arcadius

 bookmark_empire_arcadius_desc:0 "Following the death of Theodosius I, his eldest son, Arcadius inherited the eastern territories of the Roman Empire, with his capital in Constantinople. Although he is 18 years of age, he is ineffectual in ruling over an empire, so the administration is handled by his advisors and courtiers. Can Arcadius take up his responsibilites as emperor and lead the Eastern Roman Empire into a golden age, or let it rot under corruption and the threat of the Hunnic and Sassanid Empires?#!"
