 bm_476_ravenna:0 "The Fall of Ravenna"
 bm_476_ravenna_desc:1 "The Ostrogothic general, Odoacer has overthrown Orestes and his son, Emperor Romulus Agustulus after capturing the capital at Ravenna. The Western Empire has now fallen, and the former lands of the Fallen Eagle have been overrun with Goths, Vandals, Franks, and Burgundians. Millions of Romans now live under Germanic occupation and the great, opulant cities of the former empire are now nothing more than ruins overtaken by Gaia's children. Soissons is the last remaining bastion of Western Roman authority, isolated in Northern Gaul and surrounded by hostile Franks. \n\n#bold Western Europe's destiny seems bleak, but perhaps one can overcome the storms of darkness and bring back order and stability to these troubled lands.#!"
