# These people were the last Egyptian pagans and were holders of a temple in Philae near Aswan
# They were a hereditary family of priests of Isis going back at least 3 generations
# Nesmeterakhem made an inscription relating to Egyptian paganism in heiroglyphs in 394
# Although Egyptian priets and demotic writing are attested in the 5th century CE, the 394 CE inscription is the last known one in hieroglyphics
# Whether they are Egyptian or Nubian is also hard to know
